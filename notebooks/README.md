# TradingPipeline.jl/notebooks

## 00.jl (TODO)

- This notebook uses:
  + registered packages 
  + unregistered TradingPipeline.jl from this package.

## 01.jl

- This notebook uses:
  + registered packages
  + unregistered TradingPipeline.jl
  + assumes CryptoMarketData.jl has already downloaded some sample data.

## 02.jl

- I want this notebook to be a template for notebook-based backtesting sessions.
- It makes assumptions about where my other libraries are checked out.
  + It's setup to load development versions of most of my libraries.
- To use it, copy it to another file in the same directory and load it into Pluto.
